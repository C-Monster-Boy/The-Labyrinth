    BirdsEye:
      This power allows the player to view the maze from the top so as to decide their path.
    Phase Out:
      This power allows the user to pass through the enemy bot and turn invisible to the naked eye. However the bot can still see you as       it is eqipped with infrared heat sensors. So this power helps the player get out of situations such as being cornered by the bot.
    Breadcrumb:
      Not a power but a useful item nonetheless. Drop a breadcrumb as a marker that you have passed through the place. U can pick up the       breadcrumb by walking over it.
